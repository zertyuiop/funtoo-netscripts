This example shows how you might configure a fast 2Gbps intra-server link.
eth4 and eth5 (let's assume this is an Intel PCI Express dual-port gigabit
adapter) are bonded, creating the "bond0" device, which is then added to the
br1 bridge. The br1 bridge is configured with an non-routeable IP. No DNS
information is associated with this network connection, so there is no call to
resolvconf.

We do not need to set route information, since a network route will be
automatically created for br1 when we assign an IP address to it (type "route
-n" to verify).

Other network devices, such as OpenVZ or Xen virtual ethernet devices, can be
added to the bridge as well. The MTU for all interfaces is set to 9000 bytes.
